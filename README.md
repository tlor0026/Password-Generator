For the Password Generator itself please use tis script: https://tlor0026.github.io/Password-Generator/
Please use this to generate a random password for usage. To combat the grwoing threats of password hacking it is advised to create a password with numours characters. By creating a password with multipul types of characters along will raise your chances of your password being cracked in the open web.

My password generator allows you to choose up to 128 characters with a low of 8.
You will also be required to choose at least 1 of the 4 special characters.
